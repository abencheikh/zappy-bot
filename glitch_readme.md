#### Set up your Slack Application 
Once you have setup your Botkit development enviroment, the next thing you will want to do is set up a new Slack application via the [Slack developer portal](https://api.slack.com/). This is a multi-step process, but only takes a few minutes. 

* [Read this step-by-step guide](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit/blob/master/docs/slack-events-api.md) to make sure everything is set up. 

* We also have this [handy video walkthrough](https://youtu.be/us2zdf0vRz0) for setting up this project with Glitch.

Update the `.env` file with your newly acquired tokens.

Launch your bot application by typing:

`node .`
